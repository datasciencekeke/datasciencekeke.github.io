# Practical Scientific Experimentation in AI / ML / Data Science

A concise field guide for conducting rigorous, reproducible, and scientifically valid experiments in machine learning and data science.

Note: This is a work-in-progress site. Content is subject to frequent changes/updates.

## Why This Handbook Exists

Machine learning education often focuses on:

- Model architectures  
- Optimization techniques  
- Performance improvement  
- Leaderboard rankings  

What is often missing is disciplined experimental practice.

This handbook addresses:

- How to design valid ML experiments  
- How to avoid data leakage  
- How to report results responsibly  
- How to conduct error analysis and ablation  
- How to use AI tools without compromising scientific rigor  

It is not a theory textbook.  
It is not a framework tutorial.  
It is a methodological field guide.

## Intended Audience

- Undergraduate and graduate students in AI/ML/Data Science  
- Participants in ML competitions (e.g., Kaggle)  
- Early-stage researchers  
- Instructors seeking structured experimental discipline  

---

## Core Philosophy

A machine learning experiment is not about achieving the highest score.

It is about:

- Testing structured hypotheses  
- Controlling variance  
- Preventing leakage  
- Justifying design decisions  
- Producing generalizable insight  

High performance without experimental validity is not scientific progress.

## Structure

The handbook is organized into four parts:

1. **Thinking Like a Scientist**  
2. **Designing Valid Experiments**  
3. **Running Experiments Properly**  
4. **AI-Assisted Scientific Workflow**  

Each chapter includes:

- Core principles  
- Practical checklists  
- Common mistakes  
- Advanced notes  
- Minimal canonical references
